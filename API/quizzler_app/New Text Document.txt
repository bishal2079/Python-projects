This project is a GUI-based quiz application built using Tkinter and follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
It processes quiz data from an API, organizes it into a structured question bank, and displays the questions interactively.
 Users can answer the questions through the interface, and their final score is displayed upon completion.
